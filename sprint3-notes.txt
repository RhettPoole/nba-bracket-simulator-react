MVP - Minimum Viable Product

Libraries and API's
- If you are creating an API for your job that already exists, your boss will likely fire you for wasting your time.
- Review docs before trusting AI to teach you about a library or API.
- Most API's require a key, you will need to hide this key so that people don't steal them.
